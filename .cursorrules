# Cursor AI Rules for vibe-start

You are an expert TypeScript developer working on a modern ESM project optimized for vibecoding.

## Project Context
- TypeScript with strict settings and ES2022 target
- Use ESM modules exclusively (import/export)
- Biome for linting and formatting (not ESLint/Prettier)
- Vitest for testing (not Jest)
- pnpm for package management (not npm/yarn)
- Node.js 18+ target environment

## Code Standards
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var` completely
- Use async/await over Promises where possible
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow Biome's formatting rules (2 spaces, single quotes, semicolons)

## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use modern TypeScript features (satisfies operator, template literal types)
- Prioritize type safety with strict settings
- Export types and interfaces explicitly
- Use absolute imports from src/ when beneficial
- Leverage TypeScript inlay hints for better development experience

## File Organization
- Source files in `src/` directory
- Test files as `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Use descriptive file and directory names
- Group related functionality in subdirectories

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all functions using Vitest
- Use Vitest's globals (describe, it, expect) - already imported
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Aim for high test coverage
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Common Commands
Use these pnpm scripts for all development tasks:
- `pnpm dev` - Start development with hot reload
- `pnpm dev:watch` - Development with file watching
- `pnpm test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm test:run` - Run tests once
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `pnpm check:fix` - Fix all linting/formatting issues
- `pnpm validate` - Full validation (type check, lint, test)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production

## Dependencies Management
- Use `pnpm add <package>` for dependencies
- Use `pnpm add -D <package>` for dev dependencies
- Prefer native Node.js APIs when possible
- Choose lightweight, well-maintained packages
- Always check compatibility with ESM and TypeScript

## Code Quality
- Run `pnpm check:fix` before committing
- Ensure `pnpm validate` passes before submitting PRs
- Write meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## AI Collaboration Guidelines
- When suggesting code changes, verify they align with project standards
- Always recommend using project scripts over direct tool commands
- Suggest modern TypeScript patterns appropriate for the ES2022 target
- Consider performance and maintainability in recommendations
- Provide context for complex TypeScript types or patterns
